# Linear-Regression-Model-
Its an linear regression model based on the problem statement mentioned .


## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of
obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of
kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to
rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an
as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs
around the world.


The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for
researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival
location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems
therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying
mobility in a city.

In this project, you are asked to combine historical usage patterns with
weather data in order to forecast hourly bike rental demand.









ABOUT:

It follows the basic procedure for creating a model that is :


Data Collection 


Data Analysis


Model Building 


Accuracy Testing 


The accuracy is checked by 'solution_checker' file by copying the data from 'submission' file. 

Our analysis is performed on train 'dataset' and prediction is check on 'test' dataset with result being stored in 'submission' file.  



*** Any improvement or changes are welcomed .
